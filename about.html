                    to our favorite social media, bank, gaming, or even cat picture site, it's important to have secure passwords that keep hackers out. With all the different accounts you might have on the internet, managing passwords can be difficult,
                    and you may even decide to use one common password. This is dangerous and allows a hacker who has stolen your password from your favorite cooking recipes site to now be able to access your bank account. Due to these vulnerabilities,
                    we felt it important to make it easy for you to make strong passwords that you won't even need to remember. All you have to do is remember one strong master password for our site, and you're ready to generate passwords for other sites
                    that you can easily lookup and copy and paste!

                    <h3 class="text-center mb-3">What makes a strong password?</h3> The first thing to understand about making a strong password is understanding what makes a weak password.
                    <br><br> Hackers looking to figure out someone's password will use a number of methods. Their first step is to see if your password is among one of the most common passwords. See <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords">PasswordRandom</a>                    to see some of the most common passwords people have. Checking to see if your password is among the top 10,000 takes no more than a second for a computer. For example, a password of <i>banana</i> would be easily cracked in under a
                    second.
                    <br><br> Now you might be thinking, <i>"My password isn't on this list! I'm safe, right?!" Right?</i>
                    <strong>Wrong</strong>.
                    <br><br> If your password isn't among the most common passwords or sitting out in the open on some hacked database, the next thing hackers will do is to <i>brute force</i> your password. This means checking every possible combination
                    until your password is found. Unfortunely for you, computers are VERY fast at doing this. It could take them from a few seconds to a few days. See the Password Strength Checker above to see how long it might take to crack your password.
                    Luckily for you, adding complexity to your password means that the computer would have to take months, years, even hundreds of thousands of years to finally crack your password if it didn't already burn up from the computing. To add
                    complexity you can do the following:
                    <br><br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add more characters. This is by far the most effective thing at making a password hard to crack.
                        </li>
                        <li>Use mixed case. tHiS MEanS uSINg UPper and lowER CAsE lEtTeRs. This doubles the amount of different possibilities the computer must go through on every character assuming you were using just lower case to begin with.</li>
                        <li>Add some numbers. It's another thing 10 things the computer has to guess for every character.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add special characters such as !@#$%^&*. This depends on whether a website allows some of these characters, but this makes it even more annoying for hackers to figure out your password.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Having an awesomely complex password doesn't mean you're safe. Weak encryption from the website you're using, clicking shady links, writing your password down somewhere someone can find, sharing passwords, entering your password on a fake website, and
                    perhaps other <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)">social
                        engineering</a> techniques can result in your information being comprimised. Some of these are out of your control, but it's important to be cautious and think about what sites you want to share any of your information with.
